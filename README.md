- ** AI Recommendations:** Integrated Google Gemini to suggest courses and roadmaps.
- ** Gamification:** Earn badges (e.g., "First Steps", "Consistency King") as you progress.
- ** Interactive Dashboard:** Visual analytics of your completion rates and skills.
- ** Mobile Responsive:** Fully optimized layout with a custom sidebar/hamburger menu.
- ** Secure Auth:** JWT-based authentication (username-based, no email required).
